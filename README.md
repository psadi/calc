## <strong>Notice</strong>
* This repository is created specifically for linux/unix operating system, The script will break on macOS or Windows

* This is not your traditional calculator replacement, I created this script to perform quick calculations which takes user input, evaluates and then displays the expression result in zenity

* I have a keybinding with my [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) which allows me to run a command

* You can get creative with the ways you can implement in your distribution like calling it from rofi or dmenu :smiley:
